## Lucid Nightmares with SGD@UVA

It's the end of the Fall 2024 semester, and I've had my last class. I was taking 18 credits and was involved with
5 different clubs at once, so I was *tired*. 

Even though I accomplished a lot that semester, I felt like it wasn't that significant.
Sure, we put on the show Guys and Dolls with First Year Players; I had launched a rocket and got a certification for it;
and we got a medal at a programming competition (which I was super proud of);
but I just didn't think these activities did much to advance my overall standing.

I felt I needed to try a leadership position, and the only place where I really felt like I could succeed was with Student Game Developers.

...

5 months later, me and my deputy director Sebastian released what might be our most polished and creative project yet: 
*Lucid Nightmares*, a 2D puzzle-platformer.

In this blog post, I'll discuss our design process, development, and share what I learned along the way.
I'll also share some tips I have for people who want to direct video games in the future like this.
