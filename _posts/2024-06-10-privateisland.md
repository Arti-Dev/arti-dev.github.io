# My Hypixel Skyblock private island

## The main island

<img src="/assets/privateisland/cave.png" alt="Cave"/>
A while back one of our co-op members built this sophisticated cave.
While we don't use most of the chests, portals, or farms in here anymore, it's a great hub for our island.

The cave leads outside to a balcony-island that features a beautiful tree and some birch wood scattered on the floor.

Not far from the cave is a small sky castle on a cloud. It's been left unfinished for a while...

## The stuff at the bottom of the island

Most SkyBlock islands that existed before the Garden update had large farms under their islands.
We built some, but not that many layers. Three pumpkin layers and a sugar cane layer - 
and for some reason my co-op partner built a layer of soul sand but never ever did anything with it.

If you don't know, it's not worth using these farms anymore because a stat called Farming Fortune is disabled on Private Islands
in favor of farming on your Garden. So these farms became obsolete, but I didn't want to take the time to demolish them.

So I spent 2-3 months building Raichu pixelart on top of the soul sand, with Litematica as an aid.

## The parkours

I put a bunch of random parkours on the island and invited my friends to set times on them.

### 3 block

This looks trivial, but it's harder than it looks.

Parkour pressure plates on SkyBlock have some kind of arbitrary delay that make them incredibly unresponsive and inconsistent.
If you walk over them too fast, they might not trigger.

So if you want to get a good time, you have to pray that all three pressure plates decide to work in your favor.

### yes and no

<img src="/assets/privateisland/no.png" alt="no"/>

Two parkours that revolve around the Jumppad on the ground. Nothing special.

### maybe

A parkour that requires you to exit the cave, jump on top of the roof for a checkpoint, and finish on the tree.

I have no clue why I made this. Guess I wanted some actually normal parkour here.

### 5x5

<img src="/assets/privateisland/5x5.png" alt="5x5"/>

This one I'm really proud of. It's literally just a 5x5 box of start/checkpoint/end pressure plates.
You still have to hit all the checkpoints in order, but they're all jumbled up, and it's impossible to see
which checkpoint is which because there are so many holograms.

I've also seen so many people accidentally restart by stepping on the start plate again, so that's funny.

oChill got the world record by setting colored waypoints for every checkpoint to make things easier.
I don't think it's being beaten any time soon.

At some point I think I'll make a sequel to this :)
