# Lofi channels to chill out to this summer

May 7th was my last final of my first year at college, and the day after I moved out of my dorm.
Which means I'm on summer break now! 

*Thing is, I've kind of spent the first week mindlessly lazing around at home...*

So let's talk about the perfect supplement to slow days... **lofi music!**

## Lofi Girl's channel.. obviously
If you've never heard of lo-fi music, the famous `lofi hip hop radio ðŸ“š - beats to relax/study to` live stream is a 
must-listen.

When I first discovered the stream in the summer of 2019, I gained a huge appreciation for not only the music, but also
the art on the stream as well. I don't know why, but I absolutely love the day/night cycle, when it occasionally rains,
and the snow that shows up during the winter. It's such a peaceful and beautiful town.

Lofi Girl also occasionally publishes playlist videos! Here's my personal favorite:

I remember when this mix first came out. I nearly fell asleep in a Geography class from listening
to it because of how good it was. Jazz is so calming sometimes...

Lofi Girl's been branching out to other genres recently. Jazz, synthwave, piano music... and that's great! Though...

## My nostalgia for the old times

Lofi Girl wasn't always called Lofi Girl - the channel used to go under the name "ChilledCow". 
I don't have many problems with that - it makes sense, since the girl on the radio was so popular...

In June 2021, Lofi Girl announced that all music provided on the channel would be **free to use** by creators. Which,
of course, sounds like a great thing, right? 

The only downside to this: a ton of music had to be removed in the process.

I noticed this because one of their playlists had a large quantity of videos that were **privated**, likely because the
individual artists couldn't reach an agreement with the channel about this free to use policy.

Which means, if there was a song played on the radio before this change, it was now **significantly**
more difficult to find on the Internet.

One of their compilation videos was removed as well - thankfully there were some people who reuploaded it...

*If you scroll down to the comments, you can see the people who are also reminiscing about the old ChilledCow days...*
